# APIM High Level

## Example justifications for APIM with Azure OpenAI

- Siloed business units purchasing AOAI model access via Paygo and running their own PTU justification analyses
- Business units individually assessing:  latency, variable throughput, scale limitations, and cost
- Scalability, reliable performance and predictable costs are important
- Several use cases are exceeding the intended capacity of Paygo.
